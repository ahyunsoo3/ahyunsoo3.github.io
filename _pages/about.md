Evolution of My Interests
=======
From 2022 to 2024, I was obsessed with machine learning—particularly with understanding and mitigating hallucinations in large language models. However, I eventually realized that most meaningful contributions were being driven by institutions with massive computational resources, leaving individual researchers to focus only on narrow downstream tasks. This made me reconsider how I should conduct my own research, especially since downstream performance depends far more on foundation models than tranditional ML's techniques.

For example, while researchers can explore task-specific modeling or optimization-centric approaches, they are largely unable to with experiment pretraining-level assumptions, which fundamentally shape entire models.

That realization shifted my focus away from hallucination and toward a different direction. I observed that nearly 97% of top-tier papers prioritize empirical results but lack genuine scientific reasoning. Scientific progress should mean more than achieving high benchmark scores. Too many papers highlight performance without explaining the assumptions they rely on, why their methods work, or which factors actually drive the results. **I want to address this gap by pursuing research that prioritizes interpretability and principled reasoning** across machine learning fields.
