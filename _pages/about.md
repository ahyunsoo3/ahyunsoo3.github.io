Introduction
======
Broadly, **my research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and database systems**. I focus on multimodal database architectures, autonomous data management agents, reducing hallucinations in large language models, and developing trustworthy AI tightly integrated with modern data systems.
<br><br>

**Multi-Modal Database Systems**: I am interested in building multi-modal database systems that integrate structured data with unstructured modalities such as images, audio, video, and documents. This focuses on designing architectures that can store, index, and retrieve heterogeneous data efficiently while enabling seamless cross-modal queries. I explore how large language models and multimodal embeddings can bridge the semantic gap between relational data and complex media, allowing users to interact with databases using natural, intuitive queries. Ultimately, my goal is to create systems that unify traditional data management with modern AI capabilities, enabling richer analytics and more expressive applications across diverse data types.

**Autonomous Data Management Agents**: I am interested in developing autonomous data management agents that combine database systems with large language models to manage data without constant human supervision. This explores how intelligent agents can learn from query workloads, system feedback, and data patterns to make optimal decisions in areas such as indexing, query rewriting, resource allocation, and performance tuning. I aim to design systems that continuously adapt to changing workloads, explain their actions in human-readable form, and maintain reliability in mission-critical environments. Ultimately, my goal is to build next-generation data management platforms that are self-optimizing, self-healing, and deeply integrated with modern AI capabilities.

**Reducing Hallucinations in Large Language Models**: This focuses on understanding why hallucinations occur, designing mechanisms that enforce factual consistency, and integrating external knowledge sources such as databases and retrieval systems to improve reliability. I explore model training strategies, evaluation metrics, and real-time correction methods that help AI acknowledge uncertainty and provide verifiable reasoning. Ultimately, my goal is to build AI systems that users can depend on—models that respond responsibly, support critical decision-making, and maintain a high standard of factual integrity.

**Trustful AI Integrated with Modern Database Systems**: This focuses on ensuring that AI models interacting with structured data produce reliable, verifiable, and transparent results. I explore how databases can serve as trustworthy grounding sources for AI reasoning, how LLMs can provide auditability when accessing or transforming data, and how to enforce consistency, provenance, and accountability across the entire AI–DB pipeline. My goal is to design systems where every AI-generated answer is backed by traceable evidence, governed by strong data integrity principles, and capable of maintaining correctness even in complex, real-world environments.
